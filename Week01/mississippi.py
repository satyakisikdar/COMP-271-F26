# Each of the four functions below prints one block letter using a series of

# once defined, we can invoke it as many times as we like without rewriting it.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Grouping functions
#
# Rather than calling s() twice in a row every time we need "SS", we define
# a function ss() that does exactly that. This is the core idea behind
# functions: identify repeated patterns and give them a name.
#
# This also demonstrates *composition* -- building new functions out of
# existing ones. ss() is defined in terms of s(), and ssi() is defined in
# terms of ss() and i(). Each level adds one step of abstraction.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------


def ss():
    # Two S's in a row. Calling ss() is equivalent to calling s() twice,
    # but the intent is clearer and there is no risk of writing s() only once
    # by mistake.
    s()
    s()


def pp():
    # Two P's in a row, for the same reason as ss().
    p()
    p()


def ssi():
    # SSI appears twice inside MISSISSIPPI (positions 3-5 and 6-8).
    # Extracting it into its own function means we write -- and maintain --
    # that sequence in exactly one place.
    ss()
    i()


# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Top-level function
#
# mississippi() reads almost like a pronunciation guide for the word:
#   M  ·  I  ·  SSI  ·  SSI  ·  PP  ·  I
# Six calls replace eleven, and every repeated subsequence is named.
#
# This is the payoff of the bottom-up design: the top-level function is
# short, readable, and mirrors the structure of the word itself.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------


def mississippi():
    m()
    i()
    ssi()   # "miss-"
    ssi()   # "-issi-"
    pp()    # "-pp-"
    i()     # "-i"
